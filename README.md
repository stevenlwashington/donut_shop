This program models the amount of donuts that each Top Pot donut location needs to make per day.

A constructor function is used to capture the properties of the DonutShop object. Each instance of the object represents one Top Pot location.

Using prototypes of the object, can generate a random number of customers and how many donuts they will purchase per hour.
