This program models the amount of donuts that each Top Pot donut location needs to make per day.

A constructor function is used to capture the properties of the DonutShop object. Each instance of the object represents one Top Pot location.

Using prototypes of the object, can generate a random number of customers and how many donuts they will purchase per hour.

I have created a form and added input tags for the following location attributes:
 -Location name
 -Minimum customers per hour
 -Maximum customers per hour
 -Average donuts purchased per customer

Also added a button tag that saves the location in the following manner:

 -Creates a new DonutShop object with the user supplied data from the input tags.
 -Appends a row to the table using the new object's hourly and daily donut totals.
